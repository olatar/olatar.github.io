In recent years, epistocracy1 as a political system has emerged as a contender to modern democracy. This is mostly related to the claim that it is unjust to expose innocent people of a risk of harm from bad governance as a result of incompetent voting by some. However, strong objections have resulted in a recognition of epistocracy as inferior to democracy. In this paper, I will show how the concept of nudging may be applied to modern democracy to get a more epistocratic voting outcome and at the same time withstand the strongest objections to epistocracy. I name this nudgepistocracy. Additionally, I will introduce two objections to nudgepistocracy as well as my responses to those objections. This paper is based on a question raised by Professor Abelard Podgorski: “Could we use nudging to get more epistocratic-type voting outcomes without restricting the right to vote?”

Philosopher Jason Brennan states that “a political regime is epistocratic to the extent that political power is formally distributed according to competence, skill, and the good faith to act on that skill.” To justify epistocracy, Brennan constructs something called “the competence principle”, where he claims that everyone has a right not to be subject to incompetent political decisions.7 Brennan states that under democracy, all citizens exercise political power over others through voting. In that sense, democracy violates the competence principle, as “empirical research has shown that […] political knowledge […] in contemporary democracies is low.” Therefore, in short, Brennan concludes that it is unjust to use democracy when a political system that does not violate the competence principle, such as epistocracy, is available.” In this paper, I will make the assumption that the competence principle is true, and that violation of the competence principle is unjust and something we ought to prevent. However, this is a debatable topic.

Brennan claims that democracy’s values are purely based on its results (instrumental values), i.e. how well it tends to promote right ends of government. Yet, other philosopher object and argue that democracy is valuable on other ways. One example is its intrinsic value, i.e. that it is good as an end in itself. Another objection is David Estlund’s demographic objection: “The educated portion of the populace may disproportionately have epistemically damaging features that countervail the admitted epistemic benefits of education.”. These objections are regarded by philosophers as satisfactory to consider modern democracy as superior to epistocracy15, even though democracy violates Brennan’s competence principle. Due to the strong objections against epistocracy, I will in this paper explore another alternative, namely nudgepistocracy. As stated in the introduction, I will show how the concept of nudging may be applied to modern democracy to limit the injustice of violating the competence principle, hence epistocratic voting outcome, and at the same time withstand the strongest objections to epistocracy. To clarify, by limiting the injustice of violating the competence principle, I will in this paper focus on limiting the number of incompetent votes. In addition, by incompetent votes, I mean morally unreasonable, ignorant or politically incompetent ones, in major elections.

Before presenting nudgepistocracy, I will elaborate on the term nudging, also referred to as libertarian paternalism. Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein introduce nudging as affecting the behavior of a person in a way that will make chooser better off, while respecting the freedom of choice. A popular example is the placement of unhealthy foods in cafeterias: if unhealthy products are placed in the back of the cafeteria, fewer will tend to be sold, resulting in healthier customers (better off). However, the customers are free to choose the unhealthy products if they like. Similarly, in the case of voting, nudging is affecting the behavior of the voter while respecting the freedom to vote. In nudgepistocracy, we are affecting the behavior in a way that results in a more epistocratic outcome while respecting each voter’s right to vote. Consequently, everyone’s right to vote must be preserved, unlike epistocracy where voting is restricted to some. Therefore, nudgepistocracy is a form of democracy, as mentioned in the introduction. But in contrast to modern democracies, the objective is epistocratic in the sense that it aims to limit the number of incompetent votes.

There are two possible interpretations of nudgepistocracy: 1) apply nudging to prevent incompetent voters from voting, thus limiting the number of incompetent votes; or 2) apply nudging to improve the competence of voters, also limiting the number of incompetent votes. Both approaches to nudgepistocracy respect the intrinsic value of democracy. However, the former method will not withstand the demographic objection. This and similar objections are widely debated among philosophers, such as Estlund, Brennan and Morero. As further analysis on those topics will be quite extensive, I have chosen to limit the scope of this paper towards the latter method. An argument reconstruction of the latter method (2)) of nudgepistocracy is presented below.

1. Nudgepistocracy respects the voters’ freedom to vote
2. Nudgepistocracy respects the intrinsic values of democracy that epistocracy does not [from 1] 3. If competent voters have damaging features because of increasing competence, it is justified on the basis that the incompetent voters still have the option to vote
4. Nudgepistocracy withstands the demographic objection [from 3] 5. Nudgepistocracy limits the injustice of violating the competence principle that modern democracies do not
6. If 2, 4 and 5, then nudgepistocracy should be introduced in modern democracies
7. Nudgepistocracy should be introduced in modern democracies.

I will now present a couple of ways nudgepistocracy may be introduced:
- Weak nudge: create a list of questions on political issues, such as immigration, climate change, minimum wage etc., and make candidates answer the questions. Give voters the option of recording their preferences on similar questions on computers in the voting booths. After that, give voters a ranking of the candidates based on the similarity of answers. In this scenario, we assume that the candidates answer the form with the intention of answering correctly.
- Strong nudge: create an institution with the objective of educating voluntary participants in politics, economics and policy. Have some sort of test criteria that makes sure participants actually acquires knowledge after completing the education. Give cash, tax cut or something similar to attract participants. It could be similar to the process of acquiring a driving license but operated by the government.

The first objection I will attend to is about the difficulty of creating politically unbiased nudges. Consider the following scenarios where political bias might occur.
- Weak nudge: the questions may be influenced by framing effects, that is, some voters may answer differently to what they actually believe based on the way questions are framed. Example of two questions about the same topic: Positive framing: “do you agree/disagree that 34% of the annual sheep killings by predators should be prevented”. Negative framing: “do you agree/disagree that we should extinct wolverines in Norway”.
- Strong nudge: it may be difficult to believe that political bias will not occur in one way or another, either from the tutor, content or from framing effects in an extensive educational program about political theory.

An objection to nudgepistocracy on the basis of politically biased nudging may be constructed as follows:

1. Nudging created to improve political competence will be politically biased to some degree
2. Some voters change their vote as a result of nudging (from nudgepistocracy)
3. Some voters change their vote as a result of nudging (from nudgepistocracy) with political bias [from 1 and 2]
4. Votes affected by information with political bias from governmental institutions are undesirable and should be prevented
5. If 3 and 4, then nudgepistocracy should not be introduced in modern democracies
6. Nudgepistocracy should not be introduced in modern democracies

I agree that a risk of political bias in nudging will exist, and that opinions based on politically biased information from governmental institutions are undesirable. However, I argue that by taking this objection further, it will be an objection to most political systems based on voting, due to premise 4. My response in premise-conclusion form based on premise 4 is as follows:

1. Political knowledge acquired from governmental institutions (education, public news (BBC, NRK) etc.) is politically biased to some degree - the content itself or in the way it is presented (framing effects)
2. Most votes are influenced by acquired political knowledge from governmental institutions.
3. Most votes are influenced by the acquired political knowledge from governmental institutions that contains political bias to some degree [from 1 and 2]
4. Votes affected by information with political bias from governmental institutions are undesirable and should be prevented
5. If 1, 2 and 3, most votes are undesirable and should be prevented
6. Most votes are undesirable and should be prevented

One way to withstand my response is to strengthen premise 4 in the objection:
4. Votes significantly affected by political bias from public institutions are undesirable and should be prevented

However, with this claim, the objection becomes weaker as it assumes that it is impossible to be certain that nudging is not significantly politically biased. So, to defeat this claim, it must simply be shown that a “close to unbiased nudge” must be achievable. I believe this to be realistic but in need of empirical research.

Conclusively, I argue that the risk of votes influenced by politically biased information from governmental institutions is always a threat. I.e. I believe that nudging suffers a risk similar to what is present in other governmental institutions in current democracies. Because of that, I believe this objection is not strong enough to discard nudgepistocracy. As an example: there is a risk of nudging to be unintentionally politically biased, but at the same time, there is a risk of the information from education or public news to be unintentionally politically biased. In addition, I would like to include a similar objection that might occur, namely the risk of nudging to be intentionally politically biased, i.e. that political parties may try to influence the nudges. However, this objection will be structured similarly to the previous one, thus met by a similar response by me. E.g. there is a risk that a political party may try to influence the nudging, but at the same time, there is a risk that a political party may try to influence education or public news (BBC, NRK etc.).

The second objection I will attend to is about the statement “making the chooser (voter) better off”, and the claim that it may not always be true for nudgepistocracy. Libertarian paternalism was previously presented as “affecting the behavior of a person in a way that will make the chooser better off, while respecting the freedom of choice.” However, for some, it might seem like a change of vote could result in a voter becoming worse off, e.g. from altruistic reasons.24 Consider a scenario where a financially wealthy voter decides to change his/her vote based on increased political competence through nudging. Because of that, a political party with higher tax-rates than the previous party wins the election, all other things equal. The voter experiences a decrease in wellbeing through higher taxes, but from increased political knowledge sees the benefits to society as greater than the decrease in wellbeing. This is a positively framed example, but the idea of a decrease in wellbeing as a result of governmental influence through nudging may be undesirable for some. Because nudgepistocracy pose a risk of that, some might conclude that nudgepistocracy should not be introduced in modern democracies. Here is the objection in premise-conclusion form:

1. The objective of nudgepistocracy is to limit incompetence among voters
2. Higher competence may lead to a change of vote that results in lower wellbeing
3. Voting such that the voter becomes worse off as a result of governmental influence should be prevented
4. If 1, 2 and 3, then nudgepistocracy should not be introduced in modern democracies
5. Nudgepistocracy should not be introduced in modern democracies

My response is to the hidden claim that wellbeing is the correct measure of how better-/worse off a voter is after changing a vote. I argue that making a voter better off is making the voter more capable of voting for the political party that ultimately represents the voter’s views, and in that sense, results in a more genuine or true vote. Therefore, it is independent of changes in wellbeing of the voter. Improving knowledge about politics, economics and policy are potential ways to achieve that, which is the objective in nudgepistocracy. Therefore, on the contrary, limiting incompetence among voters by introducing nudgepistocracy results in voters becoming better off, or at least not worse off.

In this paper, I have presented nudgepistocracy and argued why it should be introduced in modern democracies. I have also introduced two objections to nudgepistocracy as well as my responses to those objections.
